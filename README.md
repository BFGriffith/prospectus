# PROSPECTUS
> This application is a Comic＆eBook Reader＋image viewer with the design goal of being intentionally simple, minimalistic, and deliberately eschewing any cumbersome or opinionated “library management” bloat, while also taking advantage of the cross-platform capabilities and development＋deployment conveniences of Electron.
> If you prefer to manage your own files, storage, metadata, etc. separately by your own means and on your own terms, but seek a simple application to view those files, **PROSPECTUS** strives to be an application worth of that purpose.
